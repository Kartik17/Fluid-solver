# Fluid-solver
Solver to get the temperature distribution of fluids and heat transfer for three phase flow through a heat exchanger


Assumptions - 
1) The second fluid (central) has the extreme temperature (hottest or coldest)
2) Fluids are single-phased, unmixed and have no volumetric source of heat generation
3) Heat transfer area per unit base area and surface configurations are constant
4) Transverse thermal resistance of the separating sheets in a direction normal to it 'z' direction is negligible
