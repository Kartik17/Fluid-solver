# Fluid-solver
Solver to get the temperature distribution of fluids and heat transfer for three phase flow through a heat exchanger

Dependencies
============
- Python
- Numpy - <i>sudo apt-get install python-numpy</i>
- MatplotLib - <i>sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib</i>

Assumptions
===========

- The second fluid (central) has the extreme temperature (hottest or coldest)
- Fluids are single-phased, unmixed and have no volumetric source of heat generation
- Heat transfer area per unit base area and surface configurations are constant
- Transverse thermal resistance of the separating sheets in a direction normal to it 'z' direction is negligible
